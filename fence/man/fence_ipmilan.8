LAN.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
fence_ipmilan
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_ipmilan is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with 
machines controlled by IPMI.  This agent calls support software
using ipmitool (http://ipmitool.sf.net/).

fence_ipmilan accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.  
fenced sends the options through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_ipmilan
can be run by itself with command line options which is useful for testing.
