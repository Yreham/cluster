.TH fence_xvm 8

.SH NAME
fence_xvm - General purpose fencing agent for virtual machines.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
fence_xvm
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_xvm is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with any virtual
machines for which libvirt has a backend.  When used on virtual machines
which are backed by clustered storage (and thus, may be migrated about
several physical machines), there is a requirement that the host machines
are also a part of a CMAN/OpenAIS based cluster, such as linux-cluster.

fence_xvm accepts options on the command line as well as from standard input.  
If no command line options are present, fence_xvm will automatically use
standard input.  fenced sends the options through stdin when it execs the
agent.  fence_xvm can be run by itself with command line options which is
useful for testing.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-d\fP
Enable debugging output.  The more times you specify this parameter,
the more debugging output you will receive.
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIfamily\fP
IP family to use (auto, ipv4, or ipv6; default = auto)
.TP
\fB-a\fP \fIaddress\fP
Multicast address to use (default=225.0.0.12 for ipv4, ff02::3:1 for ipv6)
.TP
\fB-p\fP \fIport\fP
Port to use for all communications; must match fence_xvmd (default=1229)
.TP
\fB-r\fP \fIretrans\fP
Multicast retransmission time (in 1/10 seconds; default=20).  This
is used to tune the amount of retransmission which is done on busy networks
where multicast traffic is unreliable.
.TP
\fB-C\fP \fIauth\fP
Authentication type (none, sha1, sha256, sha512; default=sha256).  This
controls the authentication mechanism used to authenticate clients.  The
three SHA hashes use a key which must be shared between both the Xen virtual
machines and the host domain-0 cluster.  The three SHA authentication 
mechanisms use a simple bidirectional challenge-response based on pseudo-
random number generation and a shared private key.
.TP
\fB-c\fP \fIhash\fP
Packet hash type (none, sha1, sha256, sha512; default=sha256).  This
controls the hashing mechanism used to authenticate fencing requests.  The
three SHA hashes use a key which must be shared between both the virtual
machines and the host (physical) cluster.
.TP
\fB-k\fP \fIkey_file\fP
Use the specified key file for packet hashing / SHA authentication.
When both the hash type and the authentication type are set to "none",
this parameter is ignored.
.TP
\fB-H\fP \fIdomain\fP
This specifies unique domain name of the virtual machine name (or
UUID) which needs to be fenced.
.TP
\fB-u\fP
Fence by UUID instead of virtual machine name.  If specified, the above -H
parameter should be the statically-defined 36-character UUID of the virtual
machine rather than its human-readable name.
.TP
\fB-o\fP \fIoperation\fP
Fencing operation to perform (null, off, reboot; default=off).  This specifies
the fencing operation to perform.  The null operation does not actually do
anything, but allows you to check to see if communication with fence_xvmd
is working correctly (note: the result of the null operation is *always*
failure!).
.TP
\fB-t\fP \fItimeout\fP
This specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait before a response to
the multicast request before giving up (default=30).
.TP
\fB-?\fP
Print out a help message describing available options, then exit.
.TP
\fB-h\fP
Print out a help message describing available options, then exit.
.TP
\fB-V\fP
Print out a version message, then exit.
